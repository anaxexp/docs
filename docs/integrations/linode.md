## Connecting Linode server

Currently, we don't have a native integration with Linode. But you still can connect your server by following these steps: 

0. Learn [requirements and recommendations](../infrastructure/connecting-server.md#requirements-and-recommendations) 

1. Login to [Linode manager](https://manager.linode.com) 

2. Spin up a new linode

5. By default Linode uses a custom Linux Kernel version, we should replace it to the Kernel version that comes with the Linux distribution. Click Edit to view a distributionâ€™s configuration profile options as shown below and change Kernel to `GRUB2`:
