## Connecting GCE virtual machine

Currently, we do not have a native integration with GCP. But you still can connect your server by following these steps:

0. Learn [requirements and recommendations](../infrastructure/connecting-server.md#requirements-and-recommendations)

1. Log in to GCP console with your account 

2. Create a new project if you don't have any

3. Navigate to the project page and click `Get started` under `Try Compute Engine` block

4. Once GCP prepare Compute Engine for your project, create a new virtual machine instance

5. Set VM instance attributes (list of [supported OS](../infrastructure/connecting-server.md#supported-os) and submit `Create` button
