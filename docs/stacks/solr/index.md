# Solr stack documentation

!!! info "Default core" 
    Since 1.1.0 we automatically create a default solr core named `default` when no cores found.

All environment variables available for Solr configuration can be found at https://github.com/anaxexp/solr

## Creating solr core

You can create new cores via Solr admin UI or create it manually from CLI with additional parameters:

* Go to `Instance > Stack > Search Engine` page
* Copy and execute `Access container` on your host server to access the container with Solr
* Copy `Create Solr core` command (edit to change core name), execute it inside of the container. Response `200` means that the core has been successfully created.
