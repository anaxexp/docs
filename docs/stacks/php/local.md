# Local environment with Docker4PHP

Docker4PHP is an open-source project ([GitHub page](https://github.com/anaxexp/php4docker)) that provides pre-configured `docker-compose.yml` file with images to spin up local environment on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. 

## Requirements

* Install Docker ([Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation), [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac) or [Docker for Windows (10+ Pro)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows))
* For Linux additionally install [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

## Usage

{!stacks/_includes/local/db-data-persistence.md!}

1. Download `php4docker.tar.gz` from the [latest stable release](https://github.com/anaxexp/php4docker/releases) and unpack to your PHP project root
2. Make sure `NGINX_SERVER_ROOT` (or `APACHE_SERVER_ROOT`) is set to your project public directory with `index.php` (by default `/var/www/html/public`)  
3. Ensure database credentials match in your database config and `.env` files
4. [Configure domains](#domains) 
5. Optional: [import existing database](#database-import-and-export) 
6. Optional: uncomment lines in the compose file to run redis, elasticsearch, kibana, etc
7. Optional: macOS users please read [this](#docker-for-mac)
8. Optional: Windows users please read [this](#permissions-issues)
9. Run containers: [`make up`](#make-commands) or `docker-compose up -d`
10. Your php application should be up and running at http://php.docker.localhost:8000
11. You can see status of your containers and their logs via portainer: http://portainer.php.docker.localhost:8000

You can stop containers by executing [`make stop`](#make-commands) or `docker-compose stop`.

!!! info "Optional files"
    If you don't need to [run multiple projects](#running-multiple-projects) and don't use [docker-sync to improve volumes performance on macOS](#docker-for-mac) feel free to delete `traefik.yml` and `docker-sync.yml` that come with the `php4docker.tar.gz`

!!! success "Get updates"
    We release updates to images from time to time, you can find detailed changelog and update instructions on GitHub under [releases page](https://github.com/anaxexp/php4docker/releases)  
    
## Domains

Docker4PHP uses [traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik) container for routing. By default, we use port `8000` to avoid potential conflicts but if port `80` is free on your host machine just replace traefik's ports definition in the compose file.

By default `BASE_URL` set to `php.docker.localhost`, you can change it in `.env` file.

Add `127.0.0.1 php.docker.localhost` to your `/etc/hosts` file (some browsers like Chrome may work without it). Do the same for other default domains you might need from listed below:  

| Service        | Domain                                       |
| ------------   | ------------------------------------------   |
| `nginx/apache` | `http://php.docker.localhost:8000`           |
| `pma`          | `http://pma.php.docker.localhost:8000`       |
| `adminer`      | `http://adminer.php.docker.localhost:8000`   |
| `mailhog`      | `http://mailhog.php.docker.localhost:8000`   |
| `solr`         | `http://solr.php.docker.localhost:8000`      |
| `kibana`       | `http://kibana.php.docker.localhost:8000`    |
| `node`         | `http://front.php.docker.localhost:8000`     |
| `varnish`      | `http://varnish.php.docker.localhost:8000`   |
| `portainer`    | `http://portainer.php.docker.localhost:8000` |
| `webgrind`     | `http://webgrind.php.docker.localhost:8000`  |
