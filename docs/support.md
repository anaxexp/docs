# Getting Support

!!! info "Support response time"
    We provide best effort support (with exception of premium support customers), this means we do not guarantee that we will respond shortly to your request despite how urgent it is. We usually respond in EU business hours and try to give initial responses within one business day.  

!!! failure "Cannot see live chat widget?"
    You may not see live chat support widget if you have tracking protection enabled in your browser 

You can contact us in one of these ways:

* Contact us using live chat from Dashboard (widget in the right bottom corner)
* Send us an email to support [at] anaxexp.com
* Use our [contact form](https://anaxexp.wufoo.com/forms/contact-us/)
* Get community support on [Slack](https://slack.anaxexp.com/)
* Submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/anaxexp) in a relevant repository 

!!! question "Have a question about local environment?"
    We do not provide support for local environment via live chat (unless you have a premium support package) but you can ask the community on Slack or submit an issue on GitHub
