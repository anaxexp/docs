# Billing and Payment

## Overview

AnaxExp provides subscriptions on per [application instance](apps/instances.md) basis. You can find available pricing plans on [our pricing plans page](https://anaxexp.com/pricing-plans). The price specified for 1 month (30 days).

## Free Trial

We offer 1 week free trials for paid subscriptions. To start a free trial you should add a bank card. During activation of your trial you'll have to choose a pricing plan with a billing period (monthly or annual). Once the trial expired your card will be automatically charged for the first month with the amount of the selected pricing plan.

If you cancel your subscription before the end of the trial your card won't be charged. 
  
## Bank Cards

We don't store your bank cards information. We use [PCI compliant](https://support.stripe.com/questions/is-stripe-pci-compliant) third-party service [Stripe](http://stripe.com) to store cards information and process all the payments.

You can add only one card. If you want to change the attached card, just edit its information. 
 
If you want to delete attached card permanently please [contact our support team](support.md).

## Billing

At the beginning of every billing month we charge you based on the number of instances (minimum 10) in your organization regardless of their status. If the number of instances changed during the month it will be accounted at the next billing period â€“ we will either charge or refund the appropriate amount based on the instance-hours.  

AnaxExp uses recurring payment for all the subscriptions. The subscriptions automatically renewed every billing period (month or year), the card attached to the organization charged automatically. After the card has been charged the invoice will be sent to the email address of the owner user who edited the card details last. 

If you cancel your subscription before the end of the current billing period your card won't be charged.

## Invoices

We send an invoice after every charge to an email address specified in the billing email field (`Billing > Settings`) or to an email of the user who added the bank card. Additionally, you can find all invoices and download them in PDF from `Billing > Invoices` tab. 

## Billing address and VAT

You can specify all required billing details from Billings > Settings page. The details will appear on your invoices. 

## Permissions
