# Disk space management

!!! failure "Recovery after out of disk space"
    If your server did not have enough disk space to properly operate we highly encourage your to reboot the server as the state of some infrastructure components may be corrupted

## Using external volumes for applications data

If you want AnaxExp to use an external storage (mounted volume) instead of a server disk follow these steps:

### 1. Creating new volume and attaching to server

See your cloud provider documentation

* [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html)
* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-block-storage-on-digitalocean)
* ...

### 2. Mounting volume
 
* Access your server and execute `sudo fdisk -l`. Find a device name (`/dev/NAME`) of your volume
* Create `ext4` file system on the new volume:
```bash
$ mkfs -t ext4 /dev/NAME
``` 
* Create a directory where you want to mount your volume:
```bash
$ mkdir /mnt/my-volume
```
* Mount your volume:
```bash
$ mount /dev/NAME /mnt/my-volume
``` 
* To mount this EBS volume on every system reboot, add an entry for the device to the `/etc/fstab` file:    
```bash
/dev/NAME /mnt/my-volume ext4 defaults,noatime 0 2
```

### 3. Moving docker and anaxexp's data to new volume

! THIS WILL CAUSE DOWNTIME OF ALL APPLICATIONS ON THE SERVER

* Stop docker and kubernetes services (systemd):
```bash
systemctl stop kube-apiserver
systemctl stop kube-controller
systemctl stop kube-kubelet
systemctl stop kube-proxy
systemctl stop kube-scheduler
systemctl stop docker
```
* Move docker's and AnaxExp's directories to your volume and symlink them back:
```bash
mv /var/lib/docker /mnt/my-volume
mv /srv/anaxexp /mnt/my-volume
ln -s /mnt/my-volume/docker /var/lib/docker
ln -s /mnt/my-volume/anaxexp /srv/anaxexp
```
* Start services
```bash
systemctl start docker
systemctl start kube-apiserver
systemctl start kube-controller
systemctl start kube-kubelet
systemctl start kube-proxy
systemctl start kube-scheduler
```

That's it, from now on applications-related data will be stored on the mounted volume

## Freeing disk space

We recommend connecting servers with at least 20-40G of disk space and using a separate volumes for your applications data. 

### Checking disk space

You can check if you have enough disk space on your server by running:

```shell
$ df -h
```

If you want to learn what exactly on your server takes disk space, you can run:

```shell
$ du -sh /path/to/directory/*
```

Or using a tool called ncdu 

```shell
$ apt-get install ncdu
$ ncdu /path/to/dir
```

### What can I clean up?

The most heavy directories are usually:

* `​/srv/anaxexp` – contains persistent files of your applications and backups. Read below how to clean it up
* `​/var/lib/docker` – docker's volumes, containers, images data. Do not clean it up

#### Clean up docker's unused volumes and images

```shell
$ docker system prune --volumes
```

#### Backups

You can delete old backups of your applications by using the following path:
```shell
/srv/anaxexp/backups/[INSTANCE_UUID]
```

#### Deleting application instances files

!!! warning "Infrastructure 5.x"
    The following applies only for single-server infrastructure version 5.x
​
When you delete an instance AnaxExp does not delete containers' persistent files (database, codebase, etc) on your server to ensure no valuable data will be lost. Please follow the instructions below to clean up your server from these outdated files:

1. Move outdated files to a separate directory
```shell
$ docker run --rm -it -v /srv/anaxexp:/srv/anaxexp anaxexp/cleanup 'API Token'
```
2. Make sure your applications still operate correctly. Delete outdated files
```shell
$ rm -rf /srv/anaxexp/_deleted
```
