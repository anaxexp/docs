# Getting started

AnaxExp was designed to help developers deploy and manage application across their servers in the most simple fashion. Before you deploy your first application make sure you've connected at least one server and optionally a git repository. Or you can use our demo server and git server (all applications deployed to our demo server will be automatically destroyed after 12 hours).

Key concepts:

* [Application Instances](apps/instances.md)
* Infrastructure: [single-server](infrastructure/index.md) and [cluster](cluster/index.md)
* [Stacks](stacks/index.md)

How to:

* [Deploy your first app](apps/deploy.md)
* [Connect your server](infrastructure/connecting-server.md)
* [Deploy code and CI/CD setup](apps/deploy.md)

Open-source projects for local development:

* [Docker4Drupal](stacks/drupal/local.md)
* [WordPress4Docker](stacks/wordpress/local.md)
* [Docker4PHP](stacks/php/local.md)
